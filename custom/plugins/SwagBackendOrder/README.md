### Save valuable time

You want to quickly create several orders through your Shopware backend?

Then youâ€™ve found the right plugin. A simple window in the backend allows you to generate orders behind-the-scenes, with just a few mouse clicks. This is especially useful when receiving orders per telephone, email or fax.
It is also possible to base the language of the order confirmation on the language available in the store.

### Order information in one view

- Adjust each order individually
- Assign the order to an existing customer or great a new/guest customer
- Specify the language / currency of each order
- Specify the source of the order placement (phone, email, catalog, etc.) Simple product search
- Locate your product by the name or product number. Variants are also supported. When adding new products to the order, the transaction value is instantaneously calculated.

### Statistics by device type

A convenient evaluation function provides an overview of the number of orders received through each medium.
